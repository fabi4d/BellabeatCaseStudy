# BellabeatCaseStudy
How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

Bellabeat is a company that creates product for women. One of their latest products is a smart device that women can use to track their health. In this case study I will use FitBit secondary data to gain insights about smart tracker usage. The datasets and some instructions were provided by Google Data Analytics, which is a course on Cursera, developed by Google. I will analyze FitBit's data to find some problems Bellabeat might face with their new product and provide recommendations based on that study.
